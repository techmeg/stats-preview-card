## My process

Sort of stumbly actually...I thought Grid would be the right way to go, but I ended up using less grid and more flexbox. I found it difficult to size the images correctly based on the jpg designs and the bold fonts looked heavier on my screen than on the design jpg. I also had to intensify the accent color considerably when using it as a filter for the image in order to come close to matching the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I did finally use the padding trick I have read about to control the aspect ratio, but honestly, I don't understand why the proportions don't hold up in the desktop view. I would love it if someone could explain this, because I don't quite understand why it breaks down.

It was a good review for using grid which I haven't practiced much. Otherwise, not too challenging.

### Continued development

As noted above, image handling is still an area of confusion.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://pqina.nl/blog/presenting-images-in-an-aspect-ratio-with-css/) - This is the strategy for aspect ratio that worked for mobile.
